/*
 *
 * If you want to help, please read this:
 *
 * This file contains NtGdi APIs which are specific to ROS, including
 * a short comment describing the solution on how to use the actual NtGdi
 * call documented in ntgdi.h. Here are the main cases and information on
 * how to remove them from this header.
 *
 * - Simple rename. This deals with an API simply having a different name,
 *                  with absolutely no other changes needed.
 * - Rename and new parameters. This deals with a case similar to the one
 *                              above, except that new parameters have now
 *                              been added. This is also usually extremly
 *                              simple to fix. Either pass the right params
 *                              or pass null/0 values that you ignore.
 * - Rename and new structure. This is similar to the above, except that the
 *                             information is now passed in a differently
 *                             named and organized structure. Ask Alex for
 *                             the structure you need and he will add it to
 *                             ntgdityp.h
 * - Rename and different semantics. Similar to the previous examples, except
 *                                   that parameters have usually been removed
 *                                   or need to be converted in user-mode in
 *                                   one form of another.
 * - Does not exist: user-mode. This means that the API can be fully done in
 *                              user mode. In 80% of cases, our API was already
 *                              returning NOT_IMPLEMENTED in kernel-mode, so
 *                              the work to be done is minimal. A good example
 *                              are the ICM and Metafile APIs, which can simply
 *                              be removed and added into gdi32.
 * - Does not exist: GDI Shared Objects. This is by far the hardest case. This
 *                                       class cannot be fixed until Odyssey
 *                                       has a working Shared GDI Object table
 *                                       and a DC_ATTR structure in which the
 *                                       attributes, selection and deletion of
 *                                       objects can be quickly done from user-
 *                                       mode without requiring a kernel mode
 *                                       call.

/* Follow thing need be rewriten
 *
 * Opengl icd are complete hacked in odyssey and are using own way, this need be rewriten and be setup with the correct syscall
 * and the opengl32 shall using correct syscall to optain then driver interface or using the correct version in gdi32.
 * it mean whole icd are hacked in frist place and need be rewtiten from scrash. and it need enum the opengl correct way and
 * export the driver correct
 *
 * DirectX aka ReactX alot api that have been implement in odyssey win32k for ReactX shall move to a file call dxg.sys
 * there from it will really doing the stuff. And we should setup loading of dxg.sys
 *
 *  The Init of Gdi subsystem shall move into NtGdiInit()
 *
 *  The Init of spooler are done in NtGdiInitSpool()
 *
 *  The Init of the User subsystem shall move into NtUserInit()
