/* DISPLAY OWNERSHIP
 *
 * So, who owns the physical display and is allowed to write to it?
 *
 * In MS NT, upon boot HAL owns the display. Somewhere in the boot
 * sequence (haven't figured out exactly where or by who), some
 * component calls HalAcquireDisplayOwnership. From that moment on,
 * the display is owned by that component and is switched to graphics
 * mode. The display is not supposed to return to text mode, except
 * in case of a bug check. The bug check will call HalDisplayString
 * to output a string to the text screen. HAL will notice that it
 * currently doesn't own the display and will re-take ownership, by
 * calling the callback function passed to HalAcquireDisplayOwnership.
 * After the bugcheck, execution is halted. So, under NT, the only
 * possible sequence of display modes is text mode -> graphics mode ->
 * text mode (the latter hopefully happening very infrequently).
 *
 * Things are a little bit different in the current state of Odyssey.
 * We want to have a functional interactive text mode. We should be
 * able to switch from text mode to graphics mode when a GUI app is
 * started and switch back to text mode when it's finished. Then, when
 * another GUI app is started, another switch to and from graphics mode
 * is possible. Also, when the system bugchecks in graphics mode we want
 * to switch back to text mode to show the registers and stack trace.
 * Last but not least, HalDisplayString is used a lot more in Odyssey,
 * e.g. to print debug messages when the /DEBUGPORT=SCREEN boot option
 * is present.
 * 3 Components are involved in Reactos: HAL, BLUE.SYS and VIDEOPRT.SYS.
 * As in NT, on boot HAL owns the display. When entering the text mode
 * command interpreter, BLUE.SYS kicks in. It will write directly to the
 * screen, more or less behind HALs back.
 * When a GUI app is started, WIN32K.SYS will open the DISPLAY device.
 * This open call will end up in VIDEOPRT.SYS. That component will then
 * take ownership of the display by calling HalAcquireDisplayOwnership.
 * When the GUI app terminates (WIN32K.SYS will close the DISPLAY device),
 * we want to give ownership of the display back to HAL. Using the
 * standard exported HAL functions, that's a bit of a problem, because
 * there is no function defined to do that. In NT, this is handled by
 * HalDisplayString, but that solution isn't satisfactory in Odyssey,
 * because HalDisplayString is (in some cases) also used to output debug
 * messages. If we do it the NT way, the first debug message output while
 * in graphics mode would switch the display back to text mode.
 * So, instead, if HalDisplayString detects that HAL doesn't have ownership
 * of the display, it doesn't do anything.
 * To return ownership to HAL, a new function is exported,
 * HalReleaseDisplayOwnership. This function is called by the DISPLAY
 * device Close routine in VIDEOPRT.SYS. It is also called at the beginning
 * of a bug check, so HalDisplayString is activated again.
 * Now, while the display is in graphics mode (not owned by HAL), BLUE.SYS
 * should also refrain from writing to the screen buffer. The text mode
 * screen buffer might overlap the graphics mode screen buffer, so changing
 * something in the text mode buffer might mess up the graphics screen. To
 * allow BLUE.SYS to detect if HAL owns the display, another new function is
 * exported, HalQueryDisplayOwnership. BLUE.SYS will call this function to
 * check if it's allowed to touch the text mode buffer.
 *
 * In an ideal world, when HAL takes ownership of the display, it should set
 * up the CRT using real-mode (actually V86 mode, but who cares) INT 0x10
 * calls. Unfortunately, this will require HAL to setup a real-mode interrupt
 * table etc. So, we chickened out of that by having the loader set up the
 * display before switching to protected mode. If HAL is given back ownership
 * after a GUI app terminates, the INT 0x10 calls are made by VIDEOPRT.SYS,
 * since there is already support for them via the VideoPortInt10 routine.
