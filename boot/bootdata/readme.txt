1. What is Odyssey?
-------------------

Odyssey is an Open Source effort to develop a quality operating system that is
compatible with applications and drivers written for the Microsoft Windows NT
family of operating systems (NT4, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista).

2. Relationship with the WINE project
-------------------------------------

Odyssey has always intended to work with the WINE project to share as much
programming effort as possible. This mainly concerns User Mode DLLs and
still happens to a degree today. Other areas of cooperation lie in
applications and testing suites.


3. Future compatibility
-----------------------

The Odyssey project, although currently focused on Windows XP
compatibility, is always keeping an eye toward compatibility with
Windows Vista and future Windows NT releases.


4. Supporting other System Applications
---------------------------------------

The Windows NT architecture allows for subsystems, as does the Odyssey
architecture. A subsystem is an implementation of the APIs of another
operating system, allowing Odyssey to run applications from other systems. We
are already looking at subsystems for: Java, OS/2, and DOS and possibly others
in the future.
