 * ---- rpcss_main.c:
 *   Initialize and start serving requests.  Bail if rpcss already is
 *   running.
 *
 * ---- RPCSS.EXE:
 *   
 *   Wine needs a server whose role is somewhat like that
 *   of rpcss.exe in windows.  This is not a clone of
 *   windows rpcss at all.  It has been given the same name, however,
 *   to provide for the possibility that at some point in the future, 
 *   it may become interface compatible with the "real" rpcss.exe on
 *   Windows.
 *
 * ---- KNOWN BUGS / TODO:
 *
 *   o Service hooks are unimplemented (if you bother to implement
 *     these, also implement net.exe, at least for "net start" and
 *     "net stop" (should be pretty easy I guess, assuming the rest
 *     of the services API infrastructure works.
 *
 *   o There is a looming problem regarding listening on privileged
 *     ports.  We will need to be able to coexist with SAMBA, and be able
 *     to function without running winelib code as root.  This may
 *     take some doing, including significant reconceptualization of the
 *     role of rpcss.exe in wine.
