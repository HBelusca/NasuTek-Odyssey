 * 8/2/97 - Ted Felix <tfelix@fred.net>
 *          Ported to Win32 from 4.4BSD-LITE2 at wcarchive.
 *          NT Workstation already has finger, and it runs fine under
 *          Win95.  Thought I'd do this anyways since not everyone has
 *          access to NT.
 *          Had to remove local handling.	 Otherwise, same as whois.

/*
 * Finger prints out information about users.  It is not portable since
 * certain fields (e.g. the full user name, office, and phone numbers) are
 * extracted from the gecos field of the passwd file which other UNIXes
 * may not have or may use for other things.
 *
 * There are currently two output formats; the short format is one line
 * per user and displays login name, tty, login time, real name, idle time,
 * and office location/phone number.  The long format gives the same
 * information (in a more legible format) as well as home directory, shell,
 * mail info, and .plan/.project files.
