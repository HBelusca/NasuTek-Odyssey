                **********************************************


Wrap_Line = 0   Doesn't work very well. It works with elvis or talk on linux,
                but messes up bash at last line.

Enable_Mouse=1  Causes the display to slow in fullscreen mode, since the
                mouse has to be erased and then drawn again for every
                screen write.

Term_Width or Term_Height != -1 or Wide_Enable=1
                Specifying any of these can cause display problems if
                the font size is not set to auto.

Resizing the current window while running telnet can cause problems, especially
if doing so makes the buffer smaller.  This should be more of a problem on
NT/W2K than on 95/98.  Part of the problem is that the telnet NAWS option
negotiation isn't done properly.  On a related note, turning on scrollbars can
decrease performance.

There are many other bugs, most of which are documented in the code.  Just
grep the source for "FIX ME".
