The list downloadable programms is keeping on a server and updating from a server
automatically at first time thes programm is running!
For generating a list of a programm (usually a CAB archive), could be used a batch file CreateCabFile.bat
After downloading (at first time the programm runs around), this file is placing
in the same folder where downloaded programm located to future usage them.
If in some cases an unpacked file is moved, deleted or not exist, then the procedure
to create a new one would be repeated.
If the CAB file is moved, deleted or not exist, then it would be downloaded again.
