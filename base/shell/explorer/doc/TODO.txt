I noticed two things:

1) The painting isn't done quite properly in the top, right part (the
empty menu/toolbar area part) of the explorer when in SDI mode.

2) When you switch back and forth from SDI to MDI, the toolbar
settings (i.e., which ones to show) are not conserved.

I found these issues while running your explorer from Windows XP SP2's explorer.


- update problem in folders opened from the desktop in SDI mode
- Combobox to switch the second input field between "Filter" and "Command"
- rewrite autostart code and include all possible autostart locations
- read "DESCRIPT.ION" files to display file descriptions
- detect display mode changes and adjust desktop bar size
- handling of full screen applications
- implement additional deskbands
- Drag Drop and file renaming on the desktop does not work.
- implement Drag Drop from the tree view.
- activate accelerator keys like <DEL> in shell view folders
- program manager "progman" DDE server
- Windows-key combos
- Application Desktop Toolbars
- hide CVS subdirectories, may be even implement a CVS managment plugin
- printer and RAS connection icons in desktop notification area
- use multi threading for launching of programs and filling start menu subdirectories
- close start start menu when resizing explorer bar
- adjust already open windows of all running applications when resizing explorer bar
- implement blink effect in task bar for SetForegoundWindow() requests
- Execute selected programs with additional command line options ("Run" dialog with pre-filled edit field)
- switch background images with desktop switcher
- Desktop Manager: Desktop Names; Speicherung der Verteilung von Applikations-Fenstern auf die verschiedenen Desktops -> config file
- autostart doesn't work on NT4 ?
- hide desktop bar when showing full screen applications
- new start menu entry "Filemanager" close to "Explore" -> display C: and D: drive in MDI window
- Startmenu: You can open the start menu by pressing Win-key, but can't close with another hit of Win-key.
- Export von Bookmarks für IE (+ Mozilla)

- Search Programs -> performance monitor.msc -> Abort


<Nonvo> Martin, I would have a whish concerning explorer: I often want to start a program and give it some parameters. So nice featue: "Start with param..."
<tinus_> Nonvo: shell extension
<m-fuchs> tinus: we should think about installing some default shell extensions
<tinus_> m-fuchs: perhaps, but it'd be nice if they actually were shell extensions

- ShellBrowser: Probleme mit TVIF_CHILDREN (in der dritten Ebene?)


> The nits:
> * the MDI file manager top window does not seem to be aware of the scroll-wheel
> * the task bar clock color seems to be hard-coded, and so does not show
>   with the High Contrast color. Several other places have similar issues
> * there's no quick launch
> * the desktop lacks much functionality, including the ability to arrange icons
> * there are no startmenu settings/it does not heed the MS explorer ones

> Is there some means of transferring applications across desktops?
> What about (configurable) key combos to cycle/change desktops?
