# Example KDB.init file

#

# Set the disassembly flavor to "intel" (default is "at&t")
set syntax intel

# Change the condition to enter KDB on INT3 to "always" (default is "kmode")
# set condition INT3 first always

# This is a special command available only in the KDBinit file - it breaks into
# KDB when it is interpreting the init file at startup.
