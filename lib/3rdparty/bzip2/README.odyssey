2001-10-16: Imported bzip2 code into odyssey project to create a decompression
library for use by the ramdisk driver to decompress the ramdisk image into mem
Modified makefile and some source code to build a .dll with only the
decompression code.  There are 3 exports: the decompression routine, and two
function pointers that must be initialized to C malloc and free routines.
