CREDITS

The code in this tree is based (it is actually an exact copy with some
Odyssey specific extra files) on the FreeType library, version 2.3.0
It was written and is being maintained by the FreeType team. The projects
website is http://www.freetype.org.


NOTES

Please note that there are two Makefiles in the freetype directory:
- Makefile.freetype which is the original Makefile from the FreeType
  distribution
- Makefile which is the Odyssey specific Makefile. It will use the
  original Makefile.freetype when needed.
Normally you will just use Makefile and not worry about Makefile.freetype.
There will also be 2 FreeType libraries, lib/freetype/objs/libfreetype.a
and dk/nkm/lib/freetype.a. The second one is the import library for
freetype.dll and is the one that is used in the rest of Odyssey.
lib/freetype/objs/libfreetype.a is a static library which is used to
create the DLL.


PORTING A NEW VERSION

Please note that the procedure below is a one-time only procedure, to be
performed by whoever imports a new FreeType version into the Odyssey
source tree. Once the new version has been committed to CVS all other
developers can just use the normal build procedure.

First, save the old version:

move lib\freetype lib\freetype.old

Unpack the FreeType distribution and copy the files to lib/freetype
(note: without the version number which is present in the pathnames in
the distribution archive).
Setup the FreeType build by copying the correct configuration file:

copy lib\freetype\builds\win32\w32-mingw32.mk lib\freetype\config.mk

Copy the Odyssey specific files from the old directory to the new:

move lib\freetype\Makefile lib\freetype\Makefile.freetype
mkdir lib\freetype\i386
copy lib\freetype.old\rosglue.c lib\freetype
copy lib\freetype.old\i386\setjmplongjmp.s lib\freetype\i386
copy lib\freetype.old\freetype.rc lib\freetype
copy lib\freetype.old\Makefile lib\freetype
copy lib\freetype.old\README.ROS lib\freetype
copy lib\freetype.old\Doxyfile lib\freetype
copy lib\freetype.old\.cvsignore lib\freetype
copy lib\freetype.old\objs\.cvsignore lib\freetype\objs
copy lib\freetype.old\i386\.cvsignore lib\freetype\i386

Next you need to create the freetype.def file. Since this depends on the
"gawk" command, you'll need to have MSYS installed, which is not one of
the normally required packages to build Odyssey. You can get MSYS from the
MinGW site at http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw. Once you have MSYS
installed you can create the new freetype.def file:

make freetype_def

Well, that's all there is to it. You can delete the old version in
lib\freetype.old. Please adjust the version number in the heading of this
file, so it is obvious to everyone which FreeType version we're using.
After testing, you can commit the new/changed files to CVS. ALthough files
config.mk and freetype.def are generated, they should be included in CVS.
