   * Perform a binary search.

   * The code below is a bit sneaky.  After a comparison fails, we
   * divide the work in half by moving either left or right. If lim
   * is odd, moving left simply involves halving lim: e.g., when lim
   * is 5 we look at item 2, so we change lim to 2 so that we will
   * look at items 0 & 1.  If lim is even, the same applies.  If lim
   * is odd, moving right again involes halving lim, this time moving
   * the base up one item past p: e.g., when lim is 5 we change base
   * to item 3 and make lim 2 so that we will look at items 3 and 4.
   * If lim is even, however, we have to shrink it by one before
   * halving: e.g., when lim is 4, we still looked at item 2, so we
   * have to make lim 3, then halve, obtaining 1, so that we will only
   * look at item 3.
