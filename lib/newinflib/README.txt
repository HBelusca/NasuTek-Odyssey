Routines to handle .inf files.

This is the UNICODE-enabled version of inflib. It will be used by usetup and mkhive.

This library is used to share .inf handling code between build tools and
Odyssey code. Two versions are built, "inflib_host" (for use by build tools)
and "inflib" (for use by Odyssey code). Both depend on the same core source,
with a wrapper for the appropriate interface.
Most of the differences between the host and the Odyssey environment are
abstracted away in builddep.h. Of particular note is that the host version
uses Ansi characters while the Odyssey version uses Unicode. So, the core
source uses TCHARs. builddep.h depends on a preprocessor variable INFLIB_HOST
which is defined when building the host version (inflib.mak) but not defined
when building the Odyssey version (inflib.xml).
The wrappers have "host" or "ros" in their filename. The library interface is
"infhost.h" for the host version, "infros.h" for the Odyssey version.
