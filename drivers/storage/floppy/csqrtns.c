 * PROJECT:         Odyssey Floppy Driver
 * FILE:            csqrtns.c
 * PURPOSE:         Cancel-safe queue routines
 * PROGRAMMER:      Vizzini (vizzini@plasmic.com)
 * REVISIONS:
 *                  15-Feb-2004 vizzini - Created
 * NOTES:
 *     - These functions provide the callbacks for the CSQ routines.
 *       They will be called automatically by the IoCsqXxx() routines.
 *       This driver uses the CSQ in the standard way.  In addition to
 *       queuing and de-queuing IRPs, the InsertIrp routine releases
 *       a semaphore every time an IRP is queued, allowing a queue management
 *       thread to properly drain the queue.
 *     - Note that the semaphore can get ahead of the number of IRPs in the
 *       queue if any are canceled; the queue management thread that de-queues
 *       IRPs is coded with that in mind.
 *     - For more information, see the csqtest driver in the Odyssey tree,
 *       or the cancel sample in recent (3790+) Microsoft DDKs.
 *     - Many of these routines are called at DISPATCH_LEVEL, due to the fact
 *       that my lock choice is a spin lock.
