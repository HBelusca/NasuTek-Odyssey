1. What is Odyssey?

   Odyssey is an Open Source effort to develop a quality operating system
that is compatible with Windows NT applications and drivers.

   The Odyssey project, although currently focused on Windows XP/2003
drivers compatibility, is always keeping an eye toward compatibility with
older version of Windows NT family ( NT 4.0, 2000 (NT 5.0)) and new
Windows NT releases (Vista, etc). Applications (Win32 API) compatibility
focus is Windows XP.
