 * This module implements functions shared by DLLs that need to enumerate
 * network interfaces and addresses.  It's meant to hide some problematic
 * defines like socket(), as well as provide only one file
 * that needs to be ported to implement these functions on different platforms,
 * since the Windows API provides multiple ways to get at this info.
 *
 * Like Windows, it uses a numeric index to identify an interface uniquely.
 * As implemented, an interface represents a UNIX network interface, virtual
 * or real, and thus can have 0 or 1 IP addresses associated with it.  (This
 * only supports IPv4.)
 * The indexes returned are not guaranteed to be contiguous, so don't call
 * getNumInterfaces() and assume the values [0,getNumInterfaces() - 1] will be
 * valid indexes; use getInterfaceIndexTable() instead.  Non-loopback
 * interfaces have lower index values than loopback interfaces, in order to
 * make the indexes somewhat reusable as Netbios LANA numbers.  See ifenum.c
 * for more detail on this.
 *
 * See also the companion file, ipstats.h, for functions related to getting
 * statistics.
