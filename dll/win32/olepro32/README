This library (OLEPRO32.DLL) is basically a sub-set of what is in OLEAUT32.DLL.
The main difference under Win32 is that OLEPRO32.DLL can be used
as a type library.  There are two functions in this DLL which are already 
implemented in Wine.  They are OleCreateFontIndirect, and OleTranslateColor.
The spec file for both of these functions points to the functions in the
OLEAUT32.DLL.
